                <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mix cooked rice, lump-free hung yoghurt, salt and coriander leave in a bowl.Heat up 1 tbsp oil, fry broken cashew nuts until they turn golden. Take them out and keep aside.</li><br>
                    <li>In same oil put mustard seeds when they crackle add asafoetida followed by chopped green chilli, and mix vegetables and a little salt. Fry for 2 minutes, add fried cashews and a few fried curry leaves. Switch off the flame.
                        Mix it in prepared curd rice and mix.Keep it in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.</li><br>
                    <li>For the coating, mix refined flour with 1/4th cup of water to make a lump-free batter. Mix powdered papad and rice flour in a dish.Take out curd rice from the fridge, add pomegranate and mix.</li><br>
                    <li>Make lemon size balls of Curd-Rice or shape them as you like. Cashews and pomegranate should be inside so that the fritters don't break open while frying.Roll the balls in the batter first, drain well and coat them with the papad mix.</li><br>
                    <li>Deep fry in medium hot oil until golden brown. Do not fry too much or the overly heated yoghurt will make the fritters softer.</li><br>
